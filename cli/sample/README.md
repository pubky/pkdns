## pkdns-cli sample

This is an example on how to announce your own records on the mainline DHT.

- `seed.txt` contains a 32 bytes zbase32 encoded seed that the records are published under. You can generate one with `./pkdns-cli generate > seed.txt`.
- `pkarr.zone` is a dns zone file without the SOA record. The SOA record is optional.

Publish the records by pointing to the seed and zone files.

> ⚠️ The mainline DHT will take some minutes to propagate your changes. In the meantime, pkdns might return a mix of old and new packages. This is normal.

```bash
$ ./pkdns-cli publish seed.txt pkarr.zone
